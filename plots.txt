1. Benchmark roll_off plots 

2. RC and EXP on top of each other with multiple pulses

3. Loss per epoch /batches with multiple learning steps (MSE)  (with different learning step)

4. P = 1 & P = 10 for each pulse (SIM, RC, EXP) (2 plots)

5. 0.01 = 30dB
	dB 0 - 40 step 5 (x-axis) 
	1 10logx=20  x=0.01 
2 Benchmark and 3 best of
  
  
Do the same for M = 16 && M = 256 (no training)
  
Fasma?
